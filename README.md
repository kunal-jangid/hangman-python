# Overview of the project
I aimed to write a code for Hangman game with whatever I know about python. It was a pretty awesome couple of hours working on my second project, I learned a lot of things that I will mention later on.
# Libraries used in the project
**Numpy** - To optimize the code and make it faster, save memory and learn about this popular library <br>
**Random** - To randomize the selection of word from given dataset <br>
**Time** - Basically used it to give some gap between execution of commands, as to give user time to prepare for what's coming next
# What I learnt
- I went through an ultraquick tutorial about numpy and even though I couldn't implement everything I learnt, I used it as much as I can for program optimization.
- Global variables can be tricky, an UnboundLocalError kept me in difficult position for a good few hours. However I went to Discord and asked about it in a python community. Using default arguments was my idea, however I got to know that I need to learn about `__init__` and `self`.
